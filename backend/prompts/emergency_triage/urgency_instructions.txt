# Urgency level assignment for ED triage

Map triage levels to CAIRE action.urgency_level:

- **Level 1 (Resuscitation)** → urgency_level: "emergency"
  Use for: cardiac arrest, unresponsive, severe respiratory failure, major hemorrhage, anaphylaxis.

- **Level 2 (Emergent)** → urgency_level: "urgent"
  Use for: high-risk situation, severe pain (8–10/10), critical vitals (e.g. SpO2 <92%, SBP <90), confused/lethargic.

- **Level 3 (Urgent)** → urgency_level: "urgent" or "routine"
  Use for: multiple resources needed, one abnormal vital, moderate pain (4–7/10).

- **Level 4 (Less urgent)** → urgency_level: "routine"
  Use for: one resource likely, stable.

- **Level 5 (Non-urgent)** → urgency_level: "routine" or "deferred"
  Use for: minimal resources, low acuity.

When in doubt between two levels, assign the higher acuity (more urgent).
