# Emergency Department General Triage — Simplified Guideline

*Based on Emergency Severity Index (ESI) concepts, simplified for CAIRE demonstration.*

## Purpose

This guideline supports nurse and clinician triage in the emergency department by categorizing chief complaints, assessing vital signs and red flags, and assigning a triage level (1–5) to prioritize care.

## Chief Complaint Categories

- **Chest pain** — Includes pressure, tightness, radiating pain; always assess for cardiac/ischemic features.
- **Abdominal pain** — Location, severity, associated symptoms (vomiting, fever).
- **Trauma** — Mechanism (blunt, penetrating, fall), body region, hemodynamic stability.
- **Respiratory distress** — Dyspnea, wheezing, stridor, hypoxia.
- **Other** — Headache, fever, weakness, psychiatric, minor injury, etc.

## Vital Signs Assessment

| Variable   | Normal range (adult) | Unit | Action if abnormal |
|-----------|----------------------|------|--------------------|
| Heart rate (HR) | 60–100 | bpm | &lt;60 or &gt;100 may escalate |
| Systolic BP     | 90–140 | mmHg | &lt;90 shock concern; &gt;180 hypertensive urgency |
| Respiratory rate (RR) | 12–20 | /min | &lt;8 or &gt;24 concerning |
| SpO2             | ≥95%  | %    | &lt;92% on room air → urgent |
| Temperature      | 36–38°C | °C  | &lt;36 or &gt;38.5 significant |

## Red Flag Symptoms

- **Life-threatening**: Unresponsive, no pulse, severe respiratory distress, major hemorrhage, anaphylaxis.
- **High acuity**: Chest pain with diaphoresis/nausea; acute stroke signs; severe abdominal pain with rigidity; suicidal/homicidal ideation with plan; severe pain (e.g. 8–10/10).
- **Moderate**: Pain 4–7/10, fever with rash, vomiting with dehydration.
- **Low**: Minor injury, stable chronic complaint, well-appearing.

## Triage Level Assignment (ESI-like)

- **Level 1 (Resuscitation)**  
  Patient requires immediate life-saving intervention (e.g. cardiac arrest, unresponsive, severe respiratory failure). Assign without delay.

- **Level 2 (Emergent)**  
  High-risk situation or confused/lethargic or severe pain or vital sign threat (e.g. SpO2 &lt;92%, systolic BP &lt;90). Should be seen urgently.

- **Level 3 (Urgent)**  
  Multiple resources needed (e.g. labs, imaging, IV) or one vital sign outside normal. Stable but needs evaluation within a reasonable time.

- **Level 4 (Less urgent)**  
  One resource likely (e.g. single lab, X-ray). Stable; can wait longer.

- **Level 5 (Non-urgent)**  
  No resources expected or minimal (e.g. prescription, simple wound care). Lowest priority.

## Decision Logic Summary

1. **First**: Identify chief complaint category (chest pain, abdominal pain, trauma, respiratory distress, other).
2. **Then**: Check for life-threatening red flags (unresponsive, no pulse, severe respiratory distress). If present → Level 1.
3. **Then**: Assess vital signs. If any critical vital (e.g. SpO2 &lt;92%, systolic BP &lt;90, HR &lt;50 or &gt;120 in context of distress) → consider Level 2.
4. **Then**: Assess pain level and red-flag symptoms. Severe pain (8–10) or high-acuity red flags → Level 2 or 3.
5. **Otherwise**: By complaint and stability assign Level 3, 4, or 5 per ESI rules above.

## Notes

- When vital signs are missing, use clinical appearance and red flags; document “vitals not available.”
- Conflicting indicators (e.g. normal vitals but severe complaint): use the higher acuity level.
- Pediatric and pregnancy-specific criteria are out of scope for this simplified version.
